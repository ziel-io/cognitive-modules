The explain field is meant to be a brief summary for control plane consumers like middleware, UI cards, and logging systems. It should be concise and to the point, not a detailed rationale. That detailed information belongs in the data.rationale field which has no length limit. This explain field is approximately 500 characters long which clearly violates the constraint."
